Was I crazy? No! Just listen. You’ll see how carefully, how wisely I planned everything. I wasn’t mad. Madmen don’t plan as carefully as I did.\n","\n","The old man had never wronged me. He had never insulted me or given me reason to hate him. I even liked him. But his eye—oh, that terrible eye! It looked like a vulture’s eye, pale blue with a cloudy film over it. Every time it landed on me, my blood turned to ice. I had to get rid of it forever. That eye, always watching, always judging—it had to go.\n","\n","Now, this is where you’ll see my genius. Every night, for a whole week, I crept to his bedroom door. Slowly, ever so slowly, I pushed it open. Once I had enough space, I slipped my head inside and carefully lifted a lantern, just a crack, so a thin beam of light shone on his eye. But every night, his eye was closed. And since it was the eye that disturbed me—not the man—I couldn’t do it. Killing him when his eye was shut felt pointless.\n","\n","On the eighth night, I was even more cautious than before. The room was pitch black, and he didn’t even hear me as I inched forward. But just as I was about to open the lantern, my finger slipped on the latch. The old man shot up in bed. “Who’s there?” he called out. I stayed frozen, silent. For an hour, neither of us moved. I could feel his fear in the dark, like a weight pressing against me.\n","\n","Then, I opened the lantern ever so slightly, and the thin light landed directly on the dreaded eye. It was open—wide open—and my rage took over. My heart pounded louder and louder, but I knew it wasn’t my own heartbeat. It was his! The sound of his terror fueled mine. It grew faster, louder, unbearable. I knew the neighbors would hear it. I had to end it.\n","\n","\n","With a loud yell, I rushed into the room and dragged him to the floor. He didn’t stand a chance. I smothered him beneath the weight of my body and, after a moment, the sound of his heartbeat stopped. He was dead. His eye would never haunt me again.\n","\n","I worked quickly, dismembering the body and hiding the pieces beneath the floorboards. Not a drop of blood was left behind—I had been careful. By the time I was done, it was almost morning. The house was silent, peaceful even, with no trace of what had happened.\n","\n","Then, there was a knock at the door. Three policemen stood there, saying a neighbor had heard a scream. I smiled and welcomed them in, confident in my work. I even led them to the old man’s bedroom and invited them to sit. I chatted casually, sure they suspected nothing. I was so confident, so sure of myself, that I even placed my own chair directly over the hidden body beneath the floor.\n","\n","But then I heard it. That sound. A soft, steady thumping. It started faintly, but it grew louder and louder. My chest tightened. I laughed to cover it, but it didn’t stop. The officers were still smiling, unaware, but I couldn’t take it. The sound was unbearable. It was his heart! It was still beating beneath the floor!\n","\n","“Stop it!” I screamed. “I confess! I killed him! Tear up the floorboards! You’ll see!”\n","\n","I collapsed, consumed by my guilt and madness. And there it was—his heart, still pounding, louder than ever.\n"]}],"source":["with open (\"/content/story.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n","  text = file.read() # Call the read method\n","  print
